            The BSN Computing Academy, founded by Francois Vogel in Fall 2021, was
            originally dedicated to interested programmers from his high school. But he decided to make it accessible to
            passioned developers from across the globe. He was always interested in coding and wanted to share the skills he had
            acquired over the years to coders from all over the world, to make it easier for students to start
            programming.<br>
            He started off by building BSNCA's own dedicated webpage. He wanted to deliver high-quality, tailored,
            understandable resources, accessible to everybody.<br>
            A while later, he set out to create the BSN Coding Academy OpenCourseWare (BSNCA-OCW), to make sure that no one misses
            the content of the biweekly sessions, fearing Covid-19 restrictions.<br>
            Currently, his aim is to broaden the set of resources offered and wants to provide information on topics like cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies. Our organization wants to go beyond simply helping <i>coders</i>, we want to give them the bigger picture.
