        <h1 class="text-xl sm:text-4xl text-left font-semibold mb-2">1. Learning a programming language</h1>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-xl text-left">
            The first and most important step to boost your coding skills is to learn a programming language.<br>
            The most obvious choice is probably Python, an interpreted high-level programming language with an object-oriented approach. It has a very simple and visual syntax (through indentation): a perfect choice for beginners!  A good website to start training with would probably be <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python">HackerRank</a>. However it's possible to start coding with other languages, Francois personally himself started with Processing.<br>
            Then you can move over to compiled languages like C/C++ which are very fast, especially in competitive programming contests. However these introduce new concepts, which is why - to practice - we would recommend <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset?tags=0-1000">Codeforces</a>, a website that offers a set of problems, along with solutions.
            If you're interested in web development, a possibility would be to learn Javascript/Typescript, so that you can create dynamic webpages, eventually with a Node.js back-end.

        <h1 class="text-xl sm:text-4xl text-left font-semibold mb-2">2. Problem-solving</h1>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-xl text-left">
            To improve your Data Structures & Algorithms skills, you need to learn techniques and solve some problems. In our recorded biweekly lectures, we try to cover as much topics as possible in a wide range of areas. You can always review them afterwards in the <a href="./lectures">lectures tab</a>.<br>
            We provide a collection of high-quality, tailored <a href="./problemset">problems</a>. Each one of them comes up with its own editorial and even a sample solution. We have developed a difficulty rating system for our problems, ranging from 0 to 1000:
            <table class="text-white border-2 text-lg sm:text-2xl my-3">
                <tr class="border-2">
                    <th class="p-3">Difficulty</th>
                    <th class="p-3">Level</th>
                    <th class="p-3">Target</th>
                </tr>
                <tr class="border-2">
                    <td class="p-3">0-300</td>
                    <td class="p-3 italic">Easy</td>
                    <td class="text-base sm:text-lg p-3">These problems are targeted to newbies in programming.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="border-2">
                    <td class="p-3">300-500</td>
                    <td class="p-3 italic">Medium</td>
                    <td class="text-base sm:text-lg p-3">Problems in this range are for experienced coders.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="border-2">
                    <td class="p-3">500-800</td>
                    <td class="p-3 italic">Hard</td>
                    <td class="text-base sm:text-lg p-3">Problems in this range are for seasoned programmers who regularly train on competitive programming platforms.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="border-2">
                    <td class="p-3">800-1000</td>
                    <td class="p-3 italic">Extrahard</td>
                    <td class="text-base sm:text-lg p-3">This range of problems is aimed at red or future red coders and beyond.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            The difficulty value can be found for every problem in a black circle.

        <p class="text-base sm:text-xl text-left">
            Being a productive developer is essential. We recommend using an IDE such as <a href="https://vscode.dev/">Visual Studio Code</a> (which is now available in-browser), <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> (the best IDE for python) or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> (a great IDE for C/C++). It's then necessary to install tools such as linters, debuggers, live servers to make the development process faster and more efficient. Contact us if you have are experiencing any issues or have questions regarding this.
