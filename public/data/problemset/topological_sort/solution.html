Suppose we have a function t(x) for a node x such that it returns a topologically sorted list of all descendants of x (nodes that are reachable from x).
<br>
Let \(g[x]\) denote the adjacency list of node x.
<br>
Now we can safely assume that, for every node y in \(g[x]\), $$t(x) = {x}+t(y_0)+t(y_1)+...+t(y_n)$$where \(+\) denotes the concatenation.
