Suppose we have a function t(x) for a node x such that it returns a topologically sorted list of all descendants of x (nodes that are reachable from x).
<br>
Let \(g[x]\) denote the adjacency list of node x.
<br>
Now we can safely assume that, for every node y in \(g[x]\), $$t(x) = {x}+t(y_0)+t(y_1)+...+t(y_n)$$where \(+\) denotes the concatenation.
<br>
So we can basically just do a DFS and when exiting a node we push it to a stack. Then when we pop the nodes we get the topological sort.
